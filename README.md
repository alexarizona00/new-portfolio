Hello everyone!

This is my updated portfolio repo, if you want to access the live deployment , click here: https://alexarizona00.github.io/new-portfolio/



I first grabbed a template file and re worked it to fit the needs of my portfolio. 

Updated all the links to my work, changed out the image files and pruned it down to a single landing page. 


Will continue to update, add to and improve functionality to the page as my skill level improves and I have more projects to reference.
